<!-- ## Project objective
This project was built as I was learning about the Express web framework and the Pug templating engine. Through this project I learned about the request and response objects, body-parser, routes, templates, middleware, cookies (cookie-parser) redirects, error handling, modularizing routes, route parameters and query strings, serving static assets with a static server, and much more. :) -->

<!-- ## Techniques and concepts
- Express web framework
- Pug templating engine -->

<!-- ## Code example
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// When request is made to main url
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
	// Assign username cookie to a variable
	const name = req.cookies.username;
	// If there is a username cookie
	if (name) {
		// Display the index.pug template and pass it the name variable
		res.render("index", { name });
	}
	// If no cookie
	else {
		// Redirect to /hello url
		res.redirect('/hello');
	}
});
``` -->
